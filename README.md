# Carbon dioxide (CO2): 
- Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2. CO2 can also be emitted from direct human-induced impacts on forestry and other land use, such as through deforestation, land clearing for agriculture, and degradation of soils. Likewise, land can also remove CO2 from the atmosphere through reforestation, improvement of soils, and other activities.

## DATA DICTIONARY
Column Name	Data Type	Definition
date	Int64	Year, Month, Day
co2	Float64	Carbon dioxide emissions in million metric tons



## Initital Thoughts:
- I want to use the United States co2 data
- It looks like I can set a datetime index ?
- I will need to take care of null values and drop unneeded columns
- I have a population column that I can use in comparison / percantage
- I want to look at trends / impacts of co2 emmissions in the US
- I want to compare these trends / impacts to other values in my data to see if they are related / correlation
- I want to see if I can predict new trends /identifiers that contribute to increasing / decreasing co2 levels
- Impact of alternative fuel sources / wind / water / sun / electric ?


## What is my goal?
- Find annual co2 data
- Measure annual co2 emissions
- Increases / Decreases
- Relation or direct relation
- Use these drivers to predict future co2 emissions by country
